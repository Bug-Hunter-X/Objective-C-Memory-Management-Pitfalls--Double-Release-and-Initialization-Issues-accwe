The solution leverages Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to eliminate manual memory management and mitigate the risks of double releases and improper handling of `self`. 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    myString = newString; // ARC handles retain and release
}

@end
```

By using `nonatomic, strong` for the property, ARC will automatically handle the retain and release operations, eliminating the risk of a double release.  Modern Objective-C programming almost always avoids manual memory management with ARC.  Proper handling of object initialization within designated initializers and ensuring properties are properly set before being used is crucial to avoid subtle crashes and memory-related problems.

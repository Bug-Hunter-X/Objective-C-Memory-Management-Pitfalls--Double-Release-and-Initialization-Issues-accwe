In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` mechanisms.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString) {
        [myString release];
        myString = [newString retain];
    }
}
@end
```

This code appears correct, but it has a crucial flaw. If `setString:` is called multiple times rapidly or in a complex scenario, the `release` in `setString:` might be called before the `retain` in a different `setString:` call resulting in a double `release` and causing a crash.  This is because retain and release operations are not atomic in nature.

Another less obvious issue lies in how `self` is handled during initialization. Incorrect handling of `self` within initializer methods can lead to premature releases or retain cycles. For instance, accessing properties within `init` before they've been fully initialized can result in unpredictable behavior.
